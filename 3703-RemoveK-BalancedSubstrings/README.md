You are given a string s consisting of '(' and ')', and an integer k.

A string is k-balanced if it is exactly k consecutive '(' followed by k consecutive ')', i.e., '(' * k + ')' * k.

For example, if k = 3, k-balanced is "((()))".

You must repeatedly remove all non-overlapping k-balanced substrings from s, and then join the remaining parts. Continue this process until no k-balanced substring exists.

Return the final string after all possible removals.

 
​​​​​​​Example 1:


Input: s = "(())", k = 1

Output: ""

Explanation:

k-balanced substring is "()"

StepCurrent sk-balancedResult s1(())(())()2()()Empty

Thus, the final string is "".


Example 2:


Input: s = "(()(", k = 1

Output: "(("

Explanation:

k-balanced substring is "()"

StepCurrent sk-balancedResult s1(()((()(((2((-((

Thus, the final string is "((".


Example 3:


Input: s = "((()))()()()", k = 3

Output: "()()()"

Explanation:

k-balanced substring is "((()))"

StepCurrent sk-balancedResult s1((()))()()()((()))()()()()()()2()()()-()()()

Thus, the final string is "()()()".


 
Constraints:


	2 <= s.length <= 105
	s consists only of '(' and ')'.
	1 <= k <= s.length / 2
